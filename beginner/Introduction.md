## Introduction

**What is Flutter?**

  Flutter is Google’s portable UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively-compiled applications for [mobile](https://flutter.dev/docs), [web](https://flutter.dev/web), and [desktop](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Desktop-shells) from a single codebase. [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flutter_(software)).

**What are the Platforms Supported by Flutter?**

  1. Android
  2. IOS
  3. Windows
  4. Mac
  5. Linux
  6. Chrome OS
  7. Chromium Based Browsers
  
**Who developed Flutter?**  

  Google

**What is the core part of Flutter Comprised of?**
  
  Flutter is build in Dart Programming Language 
  
**What are advantages of using Flutter as Programming Language?**  

  * Easily Adaptable
  * Is free and open source,
  * Is based on Dart – a fast, object-oriented programming language which is in itself easy to learn,
  * Provide its own widgets, drawn with its own high-performance rendering engine. They are fast, pretty and customizable,
  * The architecture of Flutter is based on the very popular reactive programming of nowadays.
  * Faster code writing
  * Hybrid, A single code Base for multiple platform
  * No need for additional code support for older devices.
  * Perfect for [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)(Minimum Viable Product), Prototype can be made easily
  
 **How flutter different from a WebView based application?** 
 
 WebView or an app that runs similarly has to go through multiple layers to finally get executed. In essence, Flutter leapfrogs that by compiling down to native ARM code to execute on both platforms.
 
 **What are the advantages of flutter compared to other Hybrid Apps?**
 
  “Hybrid” apps are slow, sluggish and look different from the platform they run on. Flutter apps run much, much faster than their hybrid counterparts. Also, it’s much easier to access native components and sensors using plugins rather than using WebViews which can’t take full use of their platform.
